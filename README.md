"# Blogging-Platform" 
For the Redintek Internship Final Round, I was assigned to create the project "Blogging Platform".

PROJECT NAME: Blogging Platform
DESCRIPTION: This Project represents a blogging website called "Blog Nest." It includes a navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the website. The page displays a list of the latest blog posts, each containing a title, image, description, and action buttons for liking and commenting. Users can also filter posts by tags. The design is styled with a green theme, and JavaScript is included to add interactivity, such as toggling buttons and hover effects. In the other pages, we can add a new blog and upload files. On the next page, we can edit the existing blogs. Finally, we can also view our profile which shows us our contact information and the posts we have uploaded.
!The website is static (that is only the js actions work.. not the backend)!

Tech stacks that I tried here:
**Python 
**fastApi
**SQL model
**Git
**javascript

Personal Experience:
This project was a challenge to me. It tested my web development skills and showed how much more I should learn to dive into the field. As i had my semesters going on simultaneously i was not able to concentrate more on this project. At times i thought of quitting the competition (even just before committing files to git). But yet I remembered my responsibilities and capabilities so i wanted to at least give it a try rather than quitting.I learned a lot from building this project. Though I have not achieved the goal, I hope the lessons learned will help my career ahead. I sincerely thank the Redintek team who motivated and helped me throughout this journey and for providing this valuable opportunity.

A few challenges i faced:
- As all of the tech stacks were new .. i didn't know how to use them..
- Problems during installation
- Problems during integration
- 
How i overcome them:
-I started to learn the very basics of some of the languages to work in them. (React, fast API, SQL model)
-For problems in installation i referred to YouTube tutorials and online tools to successfully install them.
- But unfortunately, i was unable to integrate the front end and back end... i tried my best but i couldn't achieve it.
